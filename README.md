# Gans E-Scooter Sharing System - Data Pipeline Readme
## Introduction
Welcome to the Gans E-Scooter Sharing System Data Pipeline repository!
The goal of this project is to create an effective data pipeline that collects and interprets external data to assist Gans in anticipating e-scooter movements.
Gans can improve its operational success and provide a seamless user experience by forecasting user demand and optimizing scooter placement.

## Problem Statement
Gans, an e-scooter sharing startup, operates in major cities throughout the world, competing with established companies such as TIER and Bird.
While most e-scooter firms focus on sustainability, Gans recognizes that their operational success is dependent on strategically locating scooters where users need them the most.
Gans intends to employ data-driven predictive modeling to resolve inequalities in user scooter movements.
Your objective is to create a solid data pipeline that collects real-time external data and stores it in the cloud.

## E-Scooter Movement Asymmetries
Asymmetries in e-scooter movements are caused by a number of reasons, including:

- Users frequently ride scooters uphill and walk downhill in hilly cities, resulting in uneven scooter distribution.
- Morning Commute: There is a substantial flow of users from residential neighborhoods to the city center in the morning.
- Rainy Weather: E-scooter usage drops dramatically when it rains.
- Tourists: Young visitors are potential users, but they must locate scooters in central areas or near tourist attractions.

## Data Collection and Pipeline Design
Gans plans to employ predictive modeling to solve these disparities.
The first stage is to gather important external data, process it, and efficiently store it on the cloud.
The major responsibility is to build and automate a data pipeline that does this.

- Data Gathering: Identify external data sources that can aid in the prediction of scooter movements. This might contain weather information, public transportation schedules, tourist traffic, and so on.
- Data Transformation is the process of processing and cleaning obtained data to make it usable for predictive modeling. Handle missing values, format errors, and other feature engineering that is required.
- Cloud-Based Storage: Put the processed data in a cloud-based environment that the entire firm may access. Because data is required everyday for projections, real-time updates are critical.

## Repository Structure
`scripts` -> This directory contains scripts and notebooks for scraping, collecting, cleaning and transforming data from outside sources.

`cloud_storage` -> This directory contains scripts for saving processed data in a cloud-based storage system.

`docs` -> This is where you'll find any documentation or resources connected to the data pipeline and project.

`README.md` -> This file contains a high-level overview of the project and the data pipeline.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are greatly appreciated! If you have suggestions for improving the data pipeline, new data sources, or code enhancements, please submit a pull request.

## Conclusion
Thank you for being part of the Gans E-Scooter Sharing System Data Pipeline Project!
Gans' capacity to predict e-scooter movements and maximize user experiences will be greatly aided by efforts to develop an efficient and automated data pipeline.
Let's work together to make urban mobility more sustainable and user-friendly in the future!
